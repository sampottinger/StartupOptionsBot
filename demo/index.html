                    When joining a start up, often folks will get options: stocks they can purchase but often can't immediately sell.
                    Some start ups will eventually offer employees an opportunity to sell options at profit while others may end up in a loss.
                    How can simulations can help paint a picture of potential options outcomes?

        The fair market value (FMV) may impact the taxes you might pay when you purchase your options. Specifically, you may need to pay taxes on the "spread" or difference between your strike price and the FMV. <a target="_blank" href="https://every.to/p/what-should-you-do-with-your-options-during-a-downturn">Learn more about FMV and spread</a>.
    </template>
    
    <template id="simulateFMVChanges">
        The fair market value (FMV) may change over time. That said, this simulation only assumes changes between raise rounds. In other words, it assumes the FMV does not change year to year unless there is an additional round of funding. This simplification ignores some other outcomes like mergers and other major "material" events. <a target="_blank" href="https://capbase.com/when-do-i-need-a-409-a-valuation/">Learn more about 409a</a>.
    </template>
    
    <template id="calculateFromPercentOwnership">
        The simulation needs to know how much of the company you could own. The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullydilutedshares.asp" target="_blank">fully diluted shares</a> may change over time but, if you know your number of shares and (fully diluted) percent ownership, you can generally divide your number of options by your fully diluted percent ownership.
    </template>
    
    <template id="taxSpread">
        The taxes you may pay on when you purchase your options depend on the options you received. <a href="https://every.to/p/what-should-you-do-with-your-options-during-a-downturn" target="_blank">NSOs are a simpler case to some extent</a>: they are generally taxed as ordinary income so you typically need to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/taxes/tax-brackets/" target="_blank">know your tax bracket</a>. In contrast, <a href="https://manual.withcompound.com/chapters/stock-options-101" target="_blank">ISOs may not be taxed unless you pay alternative minimum tax</a> which gets a bit more complex and <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/alternative-minimum-tax-amt" target="_blank">has its own tax rates</a>.
    </template>
    
    <template id="taxRegular">
        This simulation assumes that ordinary tax rates remain the same over time. That in mind, you need to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/taxes/tax-brackets/" target="_blank">know your tax bracket</a> to understand the rate at which you would pay taxes on "ordinary" income.
    </template>
    
    <template id="taxLongTerm">
        If one holds on to stock for a longer period of time, they may qualify for a different "long term capital gains" tax rate. <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/investing/long-term-capital-gains-tax/" target="_blank">This has its own rates that are separate from ordinary income rates</a>. This simulation assumes the required period to qualify for long term capital gains is one year from option exercise.
    </template>
    
    <template id="levelOfConfidence">
        <p>Values are randomly selected from ranges of possible values. These ranges define some distribution from which values are drawn.
        <p>In the moderate confidence case, the ranges are interpreted as defining two standard deviations above and below the mean. In the low confidence case: one single standard deviation. In the high confidence case:  three standard deviations.</p>
        <p>Note that this applies to normal distribution. Alternatively, see log normal option (not typically enabled by default).</p>
    </template>
    
    <template id="infoDilution">
        The total number of shares may change over time with funding rounds or other events, potentially decreasing your overall ownership in the company. <a href="https://every.to/p/what-should-you-do-with-your-options-during-a-downturn" target="_blank">Learn more about dilutions</a> and <a href="https://finerva.com/report/dilution-data-funding-rounds/">dilutions from new funding</a>.
    </template>
    
    <template id="logNormal">
        In addition to the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html" target="_blank">normal distribution</a>, the tool supports a <a target="_blank" href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogNormalDistribution.html">log normal distribution</a>. That said, the mean and std are interpreted literally for normal distributions but, in contrast, the log normal uses mean = 0 and std = 0.5. One is subtracted from the result and this value is then multiplied by the standard deviation provided in the UI / code and the UI / code provided mean added.
    </template>
    
    <template id="stockClasses">
        Different stock comes with different features. This is referred to as <a href="https://www.upcounsel.com/classes-of-stock" target="_target">different "classes" of stocks</a> Unfortunately, this can get quite complicated and company-specific so this simulation does not simulate different classes.
    </template>
    
    <template id="mcmc">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/monte-carlo-simulation">Monte Carlo</a> refers to a statistical technique for running simulations in systems to generate a distribution of outcomes. This approach is used in many scenarios from <a target="_blank" href="https://gleap.org/static/special/mcmc-slime-mold/slime_mold.html">modeling natural systems</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.anylogic.com/blog/monte-carlo-simulation-in-business/">business decision making</a>. Though other variables are used and this tool isn't technically using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">Markov Chains</a> are used in systems where there are discrete states that one moves between and, for this tool, states refer to funding rounds.

    <template id="acceleration">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cooleygo.com/what-are-single-and-double-trigger-acceleration-and-how-do-they-work/">Acceleration</a> refers to situations where some or all ones options will vest sooner due to one or more events. This gets pretty complex and company-specific so the simulation does not attempt to consider it. Instead, the simulation only assumes a regular vesting schedule without accelerations.
    </template>
    
    <template id="notYetVested">
        What happens to options not yet vested when there's an exit (sale, IPO, etc)? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.harnesswealth.com/articles/planning-for-an-ipo/">Situations may vary</a> but this simulation does not try to simulate profit from options vesting after exit and assumes no <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cooleygo.com/what-are-single-and-double-trigger-acceleration-and-how-do-they-work/">accelerations</a>.
    </template>
    
    <template id="sellPrice">
        <p>This simulation asks you to estimate the stock price or the overall value of the company at the point when you can actually sell your stocks.</p>
        <p>Why the distinction? After an exit (IPO, sale, etc), the stock price may go up or down before you can actually sell. In particular, some (or even many) companies impose a <a href="https://www.ipohub.org/ipo-lockups-overview-and-exceptions" target="_blank">period of time (sometimes called a "lockup")</a> when you cannot sell your stocks. This can have an impact on the actual price at which you can sell.</p>
    </template>
    
    <template id="simStop">
        In this simulation, each state is a fund raise round. Put another way, the simulation will move to the next "state" when it encounters a fund raise and will stop when there is an "exit" event (like an IPO, the company sells, or the company fails). The first state is State 0. This simulation does not try to simulate profit from options vesting or exercised after exit as it cannot simulate price changes after an exit.
    </template>
    
    <template id="yetPurchased">
        Consider the number of options vested so far. A subset or all of those options have not yet been exercised or purchased. This simulation asks you to estimate what percent of those options which are not yet exercised but are available (vested) you would want to purchase.
    </template>
    
    <template id="otherTax">
        This simulation assumes you are entering the effective overall rate on your options. In addition to possible federal taxes, note that this may include state taxes or others depending on your specific situation.
    </template>
    
    <template id="usNotice">
        This simulation is designed with the US in mind. This open source project welcomes users from outside the US and they may be able to simluate for other countries with modifications to the inputs or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sampottinger/startupoptionsbot">code</a>. That said, due to resource limitations, this project does not make it an objective to support users outside the US.
    </template>
    
    <template id="quitOptions">
        Often, employees have a limited window in which to exercise after leaving a company but additional options will not continue to vest. That said, as with most things related to options, your specific situation and choices may vary depending on the company. <a target="_blank" href="https://darrowwealthmanagement.com/blog/what-happens-to-stock-options-if-i-leave-the-company/">Learn more about what happens when you leave</a>.
    </template>
    
    <template id="cliff">
        Typically there will be some delay before options start vesting. The date when vesting starts is the "cliff" and sometimes a larger number of shares will vest then compared to what one typically sees periodically vest after the cliff. <a href="https://carta.com/blog/equity-101-stock-option-basics/#vesting" target="_blank">Learn more about vesting schedules</a>.
    </template>
    
    <template id="companyOrShare">
        Share value refers to the value per individual share (in USD). In contrast, company value is the overall company value (share value * number of shares in USD).
