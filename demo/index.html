                    When joining a start up, often folks will get options grants, stocks they can purchase but often can't immediately sell. This makes them a gamble: some start ups will eventually offer employees an opportunity to sell those options while others may not make it. How can Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches help understand the possible outcomes for start up options? This tool uses demonstrates data science and UX techniques for helping users navigate uncertainty by simulating outcomes for a start up based on assmuptions and inputs describing the opportunity.
